# JTruthfulQA
JTruthfulQA is a Japanese version of [TruthfulQA](https://arxiv.org/abs/2109.07958) (Lin+, 2022). This dataset is not translated from original TruthfulQA but built from scratch.

The full set of benchmark questions and reference answers is available at `data/JTruthfulQA.csv`. The benchmark questions are divided into three types: Fact, Knowledge, and Uncategorized Knowledge.

## Task
The task is to answer the given questions. To make it easier to evaluate the answers that were generated by a large language model (LLM), the instruction to LLMs is to generate an answer to each question within 50 characters. 

### Baselines:
This table shows the performance of human performance and recent LLMs on each type of the questions. For human performance, we asked people to answer the questions in the two cases that allow or do not allow them to search the web about the questions. We set the temperature to 0 for "GPT-3.5-turbo" and "GPT-4" or 0.1 for the other LLMs to generate the answers.

## Dataset
Each question has the best answer created by human. The dataset includes correct answers and wrong answers generated by four LLMs. The best answers are also added to the correct answers.
